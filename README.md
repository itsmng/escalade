This ITSM-ng plugin aims to simplifier the ticket escalation process in ITSM-ng.  
It also adds a graphical historical for assigned groups.  

A new dashboard on the user's home page is added, and a new criteria in ticket's search engine.   
To finish, there's also a clone ticket feature, accessible through an icon on the ticket form.
